# Feature Ideas for likhonsheikh.com

1. **Persistent Tag Playlists** – Extend the existing tag-filtered article gallery so readers can save curated playlists per locale. The current gallery already stores the active tag in the URL via `nuqs`, which makes filters shareable (`ArticleGallery` uses `useQueryState("tag", …)`), so layering a signed-in profile or cookie-backed preference store would let visitors bookmark multiple tag combinations and sync them across devices. With the reading metadata already computed server-side, those playlists could surface fresh posts as soon as new MDX files land. 
2. **Localized Newsletter Double Opt-In** – The bilingual subscribe section renders localized copy and validates email structure, but the form is static today. Wiring it to a lightweight Edge Function that triggers locale-aware confirmation emails and integrates with a consent log would turn it into a production-ready growth channel while respecting privacy expectations in both English and Bangla contexts. 
3. **MDX Component Playground** – Because posts are compiled with `next-mdx-remote/rsc` and accept React components, you can introduce an interactive component gallery inside MDX (think live shadcn/ui previews with APCA-compliant swatches). A custom shortcode component could render both Bangla and English content variants, letting authors demonstrate bilingual interface decisions inline without duplicating pages. 
4. **Accessibility Pulse Dashboard** – Globals already enforce APCA-friendly tokens and focus treatments, so adding a dashboard that visualizes contrast ratios, focus order checks, and motion preference handling for each template would reinforce the site’s accessibility story. Pulling those metrics into a `/a11y` route with MDX-driven status updates would give teams a heartbeat view of regressions before shipping. 
5. **Localized Event & Workshop Timeline** – The i18n layer already ships locale-specific titles, labels, and date formatters. Building on that, a timeline module could publish upcoming Bangla- or English-language workshops with the same date formatting helpers, plus ICS downloads and Telegram RSVP links. It keeps the educational brand consistent and drives community engagement directly from the homepage.
