Layered shadows and crisp borders do not have to fight with readability. Tailwind CSS 4 lets us express OKLCH colors directly in CSS, so we can hit APCA â‰¥ 60 while still giving components depth.

### Start with the theme layer

Declare your surface, accent, and ring colors using the `@theme` directive inside `globals.css`. Because Tailwind 4 compiles these tokens to CSS variables, components can read them without extra configuration.

```css filename="src/app/globals.css"
@theme {
  --color-surface: oklch(98% 0.02 240);
  --color-accent: oklch(65% 0.15 270);
  --ring: oklch(69% 0.22 270 / 0.75);
}
```

### Add layered shadows

Combine a soft ambient layer with a directional one. In this template, cards use `var(--shadow-soft)` so hover and focus states remain consistent regardless of locale.

1. Ambient layer keeps objects attached to the layout grid.
2. Directional layer adds just enough depth to separate stacked cards.
3. Focus ring overlays everything to maintain accessibility.

Tailwind 4 removes PostCSS config overhead, letting you focus on design decisions. Remember to test with `lighthouse --accessibility` before shipping.
