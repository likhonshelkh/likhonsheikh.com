Bangla interfaces rarely get first-class attention. We end up squeezing text into components that were balanced for Latin scripts. This starter template flips that assumption and treats Bangla as a first-class citizen.

## Measure text in rhythm units

Instead of sizing navigation links by pixels, measure line length using **rhythm units**. In practice that means 4-unit padding for Bangla, 3-unit padding for English. When you switch languages, the hit area stays generous while the text remains readable.

```tsx filename="src/components/layout/site-header.tsx"
<Button asChild variant="subtle" className="hidden sm:inline-flex">
  <Link href={`/${locale}#subscribe`}>
    {strings.cta}
    <span aria-hidden className="text-xl">…</span>
  </Link>
</Button>
```

## Keep focus rings consistent

The template leans on `:focus-visible` to avoid distracting pointer users. Because the button API uses shadcn/ui variants, the same focus ring applies everywhere without rework.

> Inclusive navigation is a design constraint, not an enhancement. When the language changes, the focus management and hit targets must remain predictable.

### Checklist for your own project

- ✅ Use `locale` in the route to decide spacing presets.
- ✅ Ensure every focusable element exposes a visible ring at 3px.
- ✅ Persist navigation state in the URL using `nuqs`.

Happy building!
